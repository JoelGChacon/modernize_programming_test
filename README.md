### Deployed project: [Modernize: Programming Assignment](https://joelgchacon.github.io/modernize_programming_test/)

## Modernized

### General requirements:

pixel perfect (on given breakpoints)
cross-browser support (desktop and mobile)
responsive design according to provided mockups (you can use 767px as a mobile breakpoint)
retina support
any copy on the page can be changed (in the source file) and it should NOT break the page
background-color should transition from #ECF8FB to #EFEFEF continuously with 5 sec duration: it takes 5 sec to change the color from #ECF8FB to #EFEFEF, then 5 sec from #EFEFEF to #ECF8FB, and so on
the page should be optimized for max performance and fast loading
The "Read more" link at the bottom opens google.com in a new window

### Form requirements:
phone field should have a mask for US phone number: (XXX) XXX-XXXX
the form should be optimized for mobile UX (do your best)
add form validation:
"Name" field requires 2 or more chars
"City" and "State" are optional
"Phone" field is required and should have validation by mask
"Email" field is required
if there's an error, the field should change the border color to #D50303
the form should submit data to https://formsws-hilstaging-com-0adj9wt8gzyq.runscope.net/solar via ajax (ignore any errors)
after successful submission, change the button copy to "Submitted" and do not allow any more submissions

### Delivery requirements:
create a Github repository with your project that we can download and run
the online demo is not required but would be great
provide us with the time it took you to complete
what took the most time, what was tricky?
any final thoughts or comments are welcome
Please send us your result by the end of the day on Jan 25th.

I'm not sure if you're on Mac or Windows, but the Sketch app is only available on Mac now.
There's another app that can open .sketch files on Windows though:

## My Response

Hello all,

Here is the project:
 - The repo: https://github.com/JoelGChacon/modernize_programming_test 
 - The online demo: https://joelgchacon.github.io/modernize_programming_test/
 - The project took me about 3 1/2 days to complete.
 - The animated background gradient was a bit tricky. I had not created an animated gradient so it took some time to get the styles right (hopefully it's what you were looking for).
 
I enjoyed doing this project.
If you'd like to give me any feedback I would appreciate it.

Thank you all for meeting with me.
